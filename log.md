# 100 Days Of ML Code Challenge

The idea is to spend at least 1 hour coding ML for the next 100 days see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo #100DaysOfMLCode  
The focus here will be on applications of ML and DL using python but I will probably also through in some 
pine script learnings too here and there.

# Day 1: 6th July 2018

**Today's Progress**: Research area 1 - customer churn. This will be the first area of research as the real world applications 
quite obvious

**Thoughts:** Collecting and recoding enough data is the challenge in this area.  Looking at some small example using sk learn.  
see http://blog.yhat.com/posts/predicting-customer-churn-with-sklearn.html

**Link to work:** TODO upload and link some jupyter notebooks and data

### Day 1: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
